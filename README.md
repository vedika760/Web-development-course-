Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications.   

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):**
HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a set of elements (tags) that define the different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML provides the foundation for web development and is essential for creating the basic structure of a website.  
**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**    
CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows web developers to define styles, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, to enhance the appearance of web pages and make them visually appealing. With CSS, developers can create responsive and attractive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.  
**JavaScript:**    
JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive and dynamic behavior on web pages. It is commonly used for client-side scripting, allowing developers to add interactivity, validate forms, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and handle user events. JavaScript is a versatile language that powers a wide range of web applications, from simple animations to complex web-based games.  
In summary, HTML provides the structure, CSS enhances the presentation, and JavaScript adds interactivity to web pages. Together, these technologies form the foundation of modern web development, enabling developers to create powerful and engaging web experiences for users.
